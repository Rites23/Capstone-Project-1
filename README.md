Finance Calculator

Project Details:

Description

The 'Finance Calculator' project is a program written in Python that was created to fulfill the level 1 Compulsory Task requirements as set in the Hyperion Development Software Engineering Bootcamp. This program was designed for use by a small financial company, to allow them access to two different financial calculators namely, an investment calculator and a home loan repayment calculator.

Functionality

When this program runs, firstly it displays a menu to the user with two options of finance calculators they can access (i.e. investment calculator or bond/ home loan repayment calculator). Depending on which calculator the user chooses, the program will then prompt the user for input with a series of questions, which will capture the information needed to calculate either their total investment value over a certain number of years, or their monthly bond repayments for a set time period. For example, if the user chooses the investment calculator, they will be asked to enter the initial deposit amount, interest rate, number of years they plan to invest for, as well as whether they wish to invest with simple or compound interest. The program will then calculate the final investment value based on the user's input and display the results in an easy-to-read, informative sentence. The same process is followed if the user chooses the home loan repayment calculator except that they will be asked for relevant input to calculate their monthly bond repayments (i.e. house value, interest rate and number of months planned to repay the bond).

Usefulness

This program displays a relatively simple, straighforward Python program that can get user input and calculate their desired option for output in an efficient, clear manner.
